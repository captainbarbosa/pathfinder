**Pathfinder** is the result of my last two week sprint at The Iron Yard's back-end engineering course.    

The goal of creating Pathfinder was to create a visually appealing, easy to use interface for itinerary planning with a geospatial aspect in mind.    

Pathfinder was created with [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) and [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/).


### Try it out

* **On Heroku**:    
   Pathfinder is deployed on Heroku [here](https://fierce-everglades-36360.herokuapp.com/)

* **Through localhost**:    
   If you have Rails installed, you can also download and run it locally by entering    
   `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, and `rails s` within the directory.
